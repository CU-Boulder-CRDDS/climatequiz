I am a PhD student at University Colorado Boulder, studying [Information Science](http://www.colorado.edu/cmci/academics/information-science) in the [College of Media, Communication and Information](http://www.colorado.edu/cmci/). I work with [Jed Brubaker](http://www.jedbrubaker.com) on topics relating to identity in online spaces.

I completed my bachelor and masters degrees, both in [Information Science and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu), from Penn State. While at Penn State, I worked with [Lynette Yarger](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/lyarger/) on topics such as diversity in STEM education, and [Ben Goldman](https://libraries.psu.edu/directory/bmg17) on archiving and preservation of digital materials.

When not a student, I enjoy finding new music, training for and competing in track and field events, and cooking and baking.
