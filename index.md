# Welcome

I am a PhD student at University Colorado Boulder, studying Information Science in the College of Media, Communication and Information. I work with Jed Brubaker on things relating to identity in online spaces.

I completed my bachelor and masters degrees, both in Information Science and Technology, from Penn State. While at Penn State, I worked with Lynette Yarger and Ben Goldman.

When not researching, teaching, or learning, I enjoy listening to music and attending shows, and I train and compete as a high jumper.
