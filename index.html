    <h2>hello.</h2>
    <div id="shortBio">
      <p>I am a <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/graduate-students/information-science/anthony-pinter">PhD Candidate in Information Science</a> at the University of Colorado Boulder where I work with <a href="https://www.jedbrubaker.com">Jed Brubaker</a> and <a href="https://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/">the Identity Lab</a>. My research focuses on understanding the experiences people have during life transitions and how those experiences are represented in sociotechnical systems. I am particularly interested in how people navigate the digital connections that are left in the wake of a romantic break-up.</p>
      <p>I concurrently hold <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/directory/atp136">a position as Adjunct Part-Time Faculty</a> at Penn State's College of Information Sciences and Technology, where I teach through Penn State's World Campus program.</p>
      <p>For more information about my past and present professional activities, see <a href="/assets/pintercv.pdf">my curriculum vitae</a>. For more about me, have a look at the <a href="/#about">about page</a>.</p>
