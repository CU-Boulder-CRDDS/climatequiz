My research interests currently revolve around the idea of identity and how it shifts online in response to a offline change. I'm interested in approaching this idea from two directions:


1. How do platforms encourage these sorts of shifts via design, and ensure that individuals' identities and identity shifts are not rejected by platform or audience.
2. What behaviors can users engage in to encourage identity acceptance from their audience (and platform, too)?
