# Open for Climate Justice: The Game

Open for Climate Justice: The Game explores the moral questions that arise when we talk about open access (OA) and climate justice. Each question requires you to make a choice similar to those researchers make when deciding how to share their work. There are no right or wrong answers and your responses will be captured anonymously and used to help us understand public opinion on OA.

Open for Climate Justice: The Game was created for Open Access Week 2022 and designed by Prashamsa Natti, along with Jack Manning and Anthony T. Pinter of the ATLAS Institute. Contributions were also provided by Melissa Cantrell, Aditya Ranganath, Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara, and Andrew Johnson of the Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship, as well as Claire Woodcock, Phil White, Abbey Lewis, and Emily Dommermuth of CU Boulder Libraries.
