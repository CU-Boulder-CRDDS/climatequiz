A lot of my tattoos include lyrics or imagery inspired from music.

This page is a chronicle of the specific lyrics and their placement. I've included a Spotify playlist of the relevant songs, and the relevant lines from each song follow with a description of how I've incorporated them into my art.

Some of the songs haven't been done yet - these are included because I'm sure enough about the idea that they will happen; it's just a matter of when.


### *Thalassa* - Prawn

> I'm glad you found
> clarity,
> in ambiguity.

Left ankle: "Clarity in Ambiguity" with a lantern (pursuit of knowledge) and two roses (passion).

### *Settled* - Prawn

> Like dawn on the sea,
> You mean everything to me.

Not done yet. I really like [Jack Ankerson's](https://www.instagram.com/jack_ankersen/) [sun](https://www.instagram.com/p/BL6Qnc1DU4K/) [rises](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMY5g3dAsIb/), so I think this will likely be in that style.

### *3 Hearts* - Johnny Foreigner

>We salute those who navigate the dark, celebrating friends, making families work. We are islands in undiscovered seas, we'll forever be separated three hearts.

Right forearm: Three unknown islands on a map. My mom drew the largest island. Large compass rose opposite.

### *Sad Suppers* - Los Campesinos!

>Seen all there is to be shown – darling I'm coming home.

Not done yet. Will be right forearm, the words on a letter in a bottle.

### *Pinky Swear* - Into It. Over It.

>So now that you and I've been given what we wanted, let's make a pinky swear that we don't throw it all away.

High left thigh: a one line, crosshatched pinky swear.

Evan Thomas Weiss explained the song at a concert (IIOI, TWIABP, The Sidekicks, Pinegrove) - it's a song about making a commitment to your craft, even in the face of great adversity or uncertainty.

### *I Got High* - Owen

>There's a boat leaving, where it goes, I don't know. But it's a chance, to see something new. Will you come with me?

Inner right arm: A combination of the three choruses in the song, on a scroll being held by a seagull.

### *Old & Grey* - Maps & Atlases

Left ribs: The album cover – a gravestone with the words "Beware and be Grateful"

### *Selling Rope (Swan Dive to Estuary)* - Los Campesinos!

>Oh I was bird right then, one day I will be again. I've telling jokes while selling rope to you.

Not done yet. Will be inner right arm, a bird holding a frayed piece of rope
